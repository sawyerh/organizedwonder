    <p>Tag Savage is a little bit in denial. He runs a blog that is followed by people he admires, but that he keeps a secret from his own family. He posts to it several times a day, but he doesn’t like to talk about it or even say its name — Sexpigeon — out loud. It doesn’t have his contact information. It doesn’t have his name. When his fiance’s friends ask “Do you have a blog?” he answers: “Nope.” But Tag Savage does have a blog, and it is called Sexpigeon, and in the five years of its existence it has changed his life.</p>
