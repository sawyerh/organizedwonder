    <h1>Alexis Madrigal: Why Startups Need To Solve Real Problems Again</h1>
    <p>Alexis Madrigal thinks our modern entrepreneurial climate has a problem: we’re not solving big problems anymore. The startup boom in the late 90s gave birth to revolutionary mobile devices. Now, the best we can do is Facebook.</p>

<p>Madrigal offers two solutions: stop the pervasiveness of “free” web apps and increase the diversity among founding teams. Fresh perspectives, he argues, will bring a new paradigm for startups – and for creativity in general.</p>

<p>0:25 - A challenge for the audience + a quick recap of his youth and college years.
1:08 - The ridiculous trajectory of social networking
2:15 - A snapshot of technology in 2004
3:33 - “We got the jetpack this time” 
4:44 - A lot of people are still thinking of the world in terms of mobile and social ventures. “I kind of think that’s over.”
5:45 - There’s not a fresh paradime for what it is we should be doing next.
6:03 - Two solutions to figure out what’s next
7:02 - The problem with growing fast with a free “viral” product
7:50 - Your privacy is your friend’s privacy
8:33 - Be a gut bacteria, not a virus
9:17 - The startup culture conquers all
10:12 - Startup Nation. The way to create jobs is to bring in startup infrastructure. 
11:39 - The myth of the “wiz kid” in startup culture
12:25 - Young white guys, startups, and the lack of diversity in startup culture.
14:00 - 6 percent of VC-backed starts are founded by women.
14:30 - Don’t ask “What’s the next big thing?” Ask “What’s the big culture?”
15:26 - “Why do we have thousands of apps that cater to 24-year old white guys?” The free and “viral” pressures reenforce that.</p>
