# Organized Wonder

Organized Wonder was orginially created in 2012 by [Sawyer Hollenshead](http://www.sawyerh.com), in collaboration with [Ed Mackowiak](https://twitter.com/edmackowiak), as a way to share and discover the best talks, documentaries, interviews, short films and various other videos scattered across the web. You could follow people you admire and share your wonders with others. 

In 2016, the site became read-only, which is what you see here.
