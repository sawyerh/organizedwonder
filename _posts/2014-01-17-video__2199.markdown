An official selection of the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.

In 1983, after years of deteriorating vision, the writer and theologian John Hull lost the last traces of light sensation. For the next three years, he kept a diary on audiocassette of his interior world of blindness. This film is a dramatization that uses his original recordings. 

Directed by Peter Middleton & James Spinney
Presented by The New York Times Op-Docs
