Compelling and powerful web applications such as Google Maps and Facebook have become mainstream and are setting a benchmark in terms of usability and design. Meanwhile, agile development is taking the software development world by storm. UX designers used to the traditional "waterfall" way of working - with lots of design documentation and big handovers - often struggle with the new development approach.

Without any claim to silver bullets, I will outline some practices and guiding principles for improving user interfaces by iterating on frontend design & code by way of sketching, wireframing and prototyping.

I intend to share some lessons learned from working in a agile development environment and talk about ways of collaborating effectively with stakeholders & team members.
