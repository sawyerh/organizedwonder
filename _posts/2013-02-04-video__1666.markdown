This talk was surprisingly given an the first Smashing Conference. Andy Clarke did not plan to talk at all and wrote this session just the day before he was on stage. A nice talk on the integration of clients into your projects. Andy has written a nice blog post about his talk at Smashing Conference (bynd.it/andyatsmashingconf) and an article on this subject short after Smashing Conference in the Smashing Magazine (bynd.it/andyatsmashingmag).
