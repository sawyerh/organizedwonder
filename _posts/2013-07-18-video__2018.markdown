Shubhendu Sharma imagines a future for cities where plucking a fruit from a tree will be easier than buying it from the supermarket. At his start-up Afforestt, Sharma creates 100-year-old forests in 10 years. Within 2 years you have a flourishing self-sustaining forest growing right in your backyard, and 30 times more oxygen.
