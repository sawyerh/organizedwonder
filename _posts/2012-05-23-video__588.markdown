SHINE is a collaborative film project produced by BIZNIK.com, an online networking community for micro business owners and solopreneurs. The project began on May 6, 2009 when 12 video crews and over 400 entrepreneurs gathered in Seattleâ€™s largest film production studio to share why they work long hours, for low pay, facing great uncertainty.
