This short film gives you a taste of what WMC is all about. On June 11-12 we had the 2nd ever Weapons of Mass Creation Fest. An estimated 800+ people attended. The event centered around design, music, and ideas and featured local and national bands, speakers, and designers across 3 venues over the weekend.
