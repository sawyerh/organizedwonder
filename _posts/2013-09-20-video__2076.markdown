A rare look at Four Tet (Kieran Hebden) on the 10th anniversary of seminal album, Rounds. Directed by Dan Wilde, and made entirely from animated stills, this intimate documentary explores the creative process, collaborations, and inspirations behind the last decade of Four Tet's career as he prepares to release the new album Beautiful Rewind (out soon on Text Records).
