This film has been written symmetrically:
the second half is strictly like the first, but played backwards and mirrored.
The second part doesn't act like a simple rewinding, but as the following of the first.
It explores all sorts of symmetry: compositions, shapes, sounds and music, scenario, colors, actions, time...

Written, directed & edited by Yann Pineill
Music by Cliff Martinez & Joseph Haydn
Starring Edouard Sanville, Daphn√© Sanville & Romane Pineill
