The winch crew travel to Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin, for one of the most aesthetically pleasing wakeskating sessions you will ever see. Watch what happens when some of the world's best wakeskaters take over a cranberry bog.

Don't worry, no Cranberries were wasted, or destroyed making this episode.
