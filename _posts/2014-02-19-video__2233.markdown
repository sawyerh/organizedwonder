Instafame is an exploration of a teenager's relationship with fame through the lens of instagram. The documentary centers around Shawn Megira, a teenager from Long Island who had 81K instagram followers, and asks questions related to the nature of fame and why so many young people see it as the ultimate measure of success.

The doc was created by Sylvain Labs, a strategic planning consultancy in New York, with the help of Greencard Pictures.
