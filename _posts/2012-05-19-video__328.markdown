British graphic designer Anthony Burrill makes acclaimed edition posters that combine witty slogans and sayings with bold typographic treatments and strong color. His unique approach to graphic language includes collaborations with filmmakers and musicians on moving image work and environmental installations for Colette, the famed Paris boutique, and the Design Museum in London. His work has been exhibited in England, the Netherlands, France, and Italy.
