"I never really planned this music career, I thought it was impossible..." says Parisian producer, Arnaud Bernard at his Soundcheck. With his unique take on hip-hop, which first ignited his interest in music as a record-collecting ten-year-old, and his ear for unusual samples, Onra has become one of the world’s most sought-after producers. Now signed to Fools Gold Records and after six studio albums, including the game-changing ‘Chinoiseries’ which was crafted from samples of Chinese and Vietnamese records he had discovered whilst travelling, Onra talks Marvin Gaye, playing Budapest, combined with footage from his sell-out second time in Australia.
