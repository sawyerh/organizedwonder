(April 8, 2011) Don Norman speaks about complexity in everyday life and how design helps us understand and cope with complexity. Norman gives many examples of complexity and design working together to create understanding for the consumer and asks, "Why do we need complexity? Because what we really want is understanding, so, it's about design."
