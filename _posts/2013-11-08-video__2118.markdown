There are as many nostalgias as there are times, countries, nationalities, traditions, beings. In order to capture the plurality of the definition, the chosen role for this purpose is that of a documentarist, an interpreter, an aesthetic observant. The film is a visual experimentation exploring these different definitions by putting together different audio and visual testimonies. Going backwards, forwards, the mind recreate a new time ; not a new house nor a lost city, but a new present.
