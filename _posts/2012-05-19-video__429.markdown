In this short talk from PSFK CONFERENCE NYC, Tina Roth Eisenberg describes how she decided to put the design work she was doing for clients on hold as she focused on creating a series of 'side projects'. For the designer known by her blog-readers as SwissMiss, a number of small bets worked out so well that her client sabbatical will now go on indefinitely.

Projects she describes in the video include the temporary tattoo brand Tattly, her lecture series Creative Mornings, her efficiency tool TeuxDeux and her co-working space Studiomates.
