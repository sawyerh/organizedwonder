A stranger asks to leave reality behind and embark on a sincere journey through the depths of modern Israeli society.
Vision facing reality,
Significance facing recognition,
The boundaries become blurry.

Original score by Gil Landau & Yaeli Cohen.

â€œThat which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is 
wanting cannot be numbered." Ecclesiastes:1,15
