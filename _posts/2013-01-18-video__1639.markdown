"What I find inspiring is how passionate Redzepi is about his cooking. It’s not just about putting food on a plate, it’s about creating an experience. It’s about taking an ingredient and pairing it with other ingredients that would grow in the very same area. It’s about taking six weeks to prepare a grasshopper garum. Everything Redzepi does is done with 120% of effort and that to me is where his genius lies."
