Place: a patch of South Bronx that splits the West Farms and Van Nest neighborhoods. Time: late in the endless winter of 2014. Subject: the basketball team at Wings Academy, a 20-year-old school developing a tradition and reputation of punching above its weight against the traditional basketball powers. Will Robson-Scott’s film follows the Academy team as it makes a run in the PSAL playoffs, introducing us to Billy Turnage, its rock-solid head coach, and Desure Buie, a diminutive point guard in the mold of Bronx legends such as “Tiny” Archibald and Rod Strickland.
