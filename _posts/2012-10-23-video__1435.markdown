Why do designers live under the tyranny of the dichotomy that they must either stay a one man show or become a full scale shop? It doesn’t have to be this way, and in fact these old models have stifled the way our industry thinks and works.

* Agency-ing definition — a crippling mental illness affecting independent web professionals where they think they must build a large agency with a huge payroll, big rents and tons of overhead in order to be successful.
