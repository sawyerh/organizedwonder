A quick recording of sketching letterforms from the inside out. Postpone drawing the actual outline until you have an idea where it is. Just drawing any line isn't going to make it the right one. Better to ignore drawing the contour altogether and focus on proportion, contrast, weight, the white shapes as well as the black shape.
