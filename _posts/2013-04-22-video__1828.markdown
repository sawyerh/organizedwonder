Smith joined forces with Victorian grower, gatherer, hunter and cook Rohan Anderson to build a pioneer-style cold smokehouse on his property just outside Ballarat. This short film by Melbourne-based production studio Commoner captures the vision of the smokehouse build and the story of Andersonâ€™s motivation. A step-by-step account of the process was featured in Smith Journal volume four.
