The Sony Music Timeline celebrates 125 years of musical history covering almost 150 square meters of wall space in Sonyâ€™s Derry Street offices. Using just CNC cut vinyl as the sole medium, 54 columns measuring over 2 meters tall cover feature nearly 1000 of Sony Music's signed artists from 1887 to the present day.
