While the Giants’ surprise victory over the Patriots made for an exciting Super Bowl XLVI at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana, Madonna’s half-time show – a spectacle within a spectacle – also provided a thrill for U.S. television viewers, drawing an estimated 114 million faithful, edging out the record-setting 111.3 million NFL fans who tuned into the game alone, not including the nearly 70,000 attendees in the stadium itself.
For Moment Factory, the challenge was considerable: Create an enhanced, immersive visual environment around Madonna throughout a 12-minute, five-song performance. With unique concepts designed to evoke the emotions of each individual song, the game-plan was not only to enthrall those in attendance, but also convey the same live energy and excitement for the many millions participating in the televised experience. With the collaboration of Cirque du Soleil’s Michel Laprise and Jean-François Bouchard, set designer Bruce Rodgers, Madonna creative director Jamie King, lighting designer Al Gurdon, TV director Hamish Hamilton and the NFL, Moment Factory made the grid-iron appear to come alive.
