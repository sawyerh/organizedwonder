In this episode we’re learning how Google Street View gets off the streets and into some of the crazier places it goes – like the Grand Canyon, the Pyramids of Giza, and the Amazon Jungle. 

If you’d like to apply to borrow the Trekker (aka the Google Street View backpack) to map a place you care about, visit: http://g.co/trekker.

Other Street View stuff we’re fans of:
