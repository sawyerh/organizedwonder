In third grade, Sarah Chase was asked what she wanted to be when she grew up. Her answer: a dairy farmer and the president. While the second quest has yet to come to fruition, she did indeed grow up to be a dairy farmer. And she isnâ€™t alone. She is one of several young, female dairy farmers featured in a recently released video series by the National Young Farmers Coalition (NYFC). The videos give a glimpse into the lives of these first-career dairy farmers as they persevere in a business not known for being easy.
