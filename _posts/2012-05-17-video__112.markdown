When Jonathan Harris ( http://number27.org ) turned 30, he began a simple ritual of taking one photo a day and posting it to his website before going to sleep, along with a short story. He called this project, 'Today'.

This is a short film about Jonathan's project, made a few weeks after he stopped it, by his friend, Scott Thrift: http://mssngpeces.com
