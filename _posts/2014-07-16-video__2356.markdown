An important question for those practicing UX strategy is "what's our engagement model with the rest of the organization?" In large organizations a variety of models are possible, from embedding with cross functional teams to working in functional silos, to a central consulting model. We don't often work directly with groups like Corporate Strategy, but when we do the impact can be quite significant. This case study looks at a project where a UX strategy team partnered with a Corporate Strategy team at Intuit. We'll delve into the details on what corporate strategy brought to the relationship, what UX strategy brought, and what impact their partnership ultimately had on the organization. In this talk, you'll see that juxtaposing corporate strategy with UX strategy in the context of a single project sheds new and interesting light on where one starts and the other stops. This has important implications for the UX community as we seek to define and grow our value to businesses.
