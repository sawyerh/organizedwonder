Towards the end of her life Susan explores her relationship with her nineteen year old daughter Samantha. Throughout the film Susan is dying of cancer - although this is not expressed definitively to the audience. Although the main concern of the film is the mother-daughter interaction, a third character is imparted through the dialogue in the form of an absent father.
