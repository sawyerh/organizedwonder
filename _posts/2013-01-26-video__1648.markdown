He refuses to believe that he could be one of those people. The woman was supposed to help fix him. But still, in spite of it all, the apparition in orange continues to pervade his mind.

I have to give huge thanks and credits to Simon J. Bloch, Leo Stevenson, and Eva Jacobs for their exceptional performance in the film. It's not easy acting on camera, but these three are naturals at it. They're brave people for undertaking these roles - this film simply could not have happened without their generous help. Thanks to each of you.
I also have to thank Geri Kirilova, Simone Policano, and Stephen Young of Hunter Film Club for providing the much needed camera for the film! It was definitely a step up from the Canon Powershot I was stuck with for most of my other projects. Heh.
This project was shot on a Canon Rebel T3 and edited together with Sony Vegas Pro 8.0.
And of course, major credits to James Blake for his masterful cover of 'A Case of You' by Joni Mitchell. I highly recommend checking out his music and making a few purchases to support this man's art.
