"A project from http://bureauofcommongoods.com, Made by Hand is a new short film series celebrating the people who make things by handâ€”sustainably, locally, and with a love for their craft.

In our inaugural film, we visit the Breuckelen Distilling Company, the first gin distiller in Brooklyn since prohibition. Founder Brad Estabrooke talks about starting from nothing and the imperfect process of perfecting a craft. His experience bears a lesson for us all: knowing you could fail brings you that much closer to success.
