The Design Studio method has become one of the most success methods in Agile and Lean UX. This rapid, iterative approach blends concept creation with critique. Design Studio is a great way to jumpstart your design process, create 300-400 design concepts in just a couple of hours, or get team buy-in and ownership. You’ll learn the process mechanics along with tips and tricks from experienced practitioners – everything you’ll need to try this on your own project.
