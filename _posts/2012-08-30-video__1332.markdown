Landscape Abbreviated is a kinetic maze consisting of modular elements with rotating planters, which form a garden that is simultaneously a machine. The planters contain live moss collected from the sides of buildings, cracks in the pavement, subway grates and other urban nooks and crannies in New York Cityâ€™s landscape. Full of particles of broken glass, plastic and other detritus, they form a patchwork of unintentional archaeology. | by Nova Jiang
