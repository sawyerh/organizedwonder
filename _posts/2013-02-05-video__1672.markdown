The web is universal, so we should practice a typography that is equally universal. By focusing on traditional typographic principles, embracing progressive enhancement, and understanding how fonts, CSS, web-enabled devices, and user contexts coexist, we can reevaluate what it means to successfully set type â€” and inform the decisions we make about typefaces, font sizes, and white space. Let's practice future-friendly, responsive typography.
