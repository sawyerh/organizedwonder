Brothers is a short film about the modern difficulty of communicating with your family.

Two brothers embark on a road trip home for their grandmother's funeral. But on a highway rest stop, David Stern finds out no one's told his younger brother Andy â€“ they're not headed home for Grandma Vern's birthday anymore. Now David must confront his mother and bear the bad news to Andy, as only brothers can.
