"I am recording 1 second everyday for the rest of my life... this is me at age 30.
This premiered during my TED talk on March 2nd at TED2012 in Long Beach, CA.

I spent a couple of years saving enough money to be able to take a frugal year off from work my entire 30th year of life... I spent it doing all the important things I never had enough time for... travel, my own creative projects, & family."
