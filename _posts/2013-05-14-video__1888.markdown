Created from 291 paper letters and 2,454 single photographs painstakingly arranged in 140 hours of work, this amazing animated short by Canadian graphic designer Ben Barret-Forrest tells the captivating story of typography. Tracing it back all the way to Johannes Gutenberg and his revolutionary invention of letterpress printing, he gives a brief account of all the significant developments of the last 500 years, including the introduction of italics and serifs, san-serifs and pixel type.
