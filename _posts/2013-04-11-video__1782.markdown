It’s rare for Austin  City Limits to feature a band that has played only a few live shows together. But when that band is a supergroup made up of some of rock’s finest musicians, it really is no surprise.

Them Crooked Vultures features Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters on drums and backing vocals, Josh Homme of  Queens of the Stone Age on guitar and vocals and John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin fame on bass, keyboards and backing vocals. Together, these musicians represent decades of rock history. As Them Crooked Vultures, the band is just making their mark, having made their public debut in 2009 during Lollapalooza.

Despite having played only a few gigs, Them Crooked Vultures has been hailed as “one of the rarest things in rock: a supergroup that not only deserves that appellation, but which actually is greater than the sum of its storied parts,” by the Chicago Sun-Times while the Chicago Tribune opined “The term ’supergroup’ gets thrown around way too often in rock, but in the case of Them Crooked Vultures, it applies.”

The band also recently wrapped a string of surprise appearances across Europe and the UK, of which the Times of London remarked “the sound climbed to super-threatening levels and the music new heights of heaviosity… this was a monster on the loose” and the Sun added “there were moments of gentleness too – including some mesmerising piano work from Jones.”
