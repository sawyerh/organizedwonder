At the age of 23, Zach sold his company Vimeo. But as soon as he sold his company, he wanted nothing more than to have those wings again. He missed it. He realised he wanted to keep flying. Zach humbly offers advise on what he's doing now (DIY.org) and the lessons he's learned that have informed his own company. Why doing something valuable that solves worthy challenges, contributes to culture, standing up for what's important, and behaving as if your company is going to be here 100 years from now, matters.
