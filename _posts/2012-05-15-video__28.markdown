A Video From InfinityList.com

In February 2011, the five times world champions Fred Fugen and Vince Reffett from Soul Flyers were invited to Melbourne to provide advanced 3D coaching to some of Australia's leading Skydive athlete talent.

The goal of the Training camp and the production were:
1. To increase participation in our sport.
2. Provide greater pathways for our elite athletes.
