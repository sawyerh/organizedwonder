From https://vimeo.com/103984483:

Wasted Rita calls herself a graphic designer and illustrator. Others call her an artist. Although based in Portugal, she needs to stay in constant motion, so she can continue to be inspired by the world around her. Her pieces are sarcastic but sincere, and her wit can often come with a bite.

Ritaâ€™s work has been on display in Paris, London, Berlin, and all throughout Portugal. Her clients include Ginza Magazine (JP), Samsung, Delta Q, Converse and J&B. In addition to following her blog, you can buy her stuff from her official web shop, or her pages on Society6 and Juniqe.
