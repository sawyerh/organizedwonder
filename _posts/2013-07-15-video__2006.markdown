Did you know that The American Heart Association’s daily recommended sugar allowance is 36 grams for men, 20 grams for women, and 12 grams for kids? Did you know that our daily intake averages 95 grams?

The Sugary Truth is an animated video that illustrates and explains the bittersweet facts about sugar consumption and what it’s doing to America’s health. We created this movie to be a conversation starter for families and friends everywhere. We want kids and parents to see that the solution is not avoiding sugar completely, it’s more about helping children — helping everyone, actually — make smarter choices when no one is watching over their shoulders.
