In November of 2012 CreativeMornings (creativemornings.com) teamed up with Spectrum (metmuseum.org/events/programs/spectrum) - an initiative by The Metropolitan Museum of Art - and invited designer George Lois (georgelois.com) to the Met in celebration of the exhibition Faking It: Manipulated Photography Before Photoshop. Lois is perhaps best known for the more than ninety-two covers he designed for Esquire magazine between 1962 and 1972, but he is also a prolific art director and author.

The event took place in The Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on Friday, November 16, 2012! It was filmed by Met staff and edited by Ben Hallman (hallmanproductions.com).
