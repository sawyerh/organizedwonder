Usually the talk was called "Responsive is as Responsive Does" as the title slide shows. Josh changed it to "Responsive Times Call For Responsive Measures".
Here is the original description:
The talk is an attempt to deprogram our approach to Web design for the last 15 years by taking a look at the history of graphic design (type, grids, etc) and how it has shaped our thinking (positively & negatively). The presentation discusses new approaches to designing responsively and what we can learn from the past.
A lot of the talk is about how Josh created the "Responsive-Measure", a jQuery plugin for generating a responsive ideal measure. We hope you like it as much as we did.
