I'm making a work of art that reframes social networking as my medium.  I am an interactive artist; my newest piece is GLOBALL. Here's what I'm doing: I want to pass seven beautifully made wooden balls, hand to hand, person to person, around the world. Each ball uses wood sourced from one of the seven continents.

On each of these balls are be the instructions of what to do in 3 major languages and in pictograms. The instructions tell you to
1. Photograph your self with the ball, 
2. Upload your pic to www.wheresgloball.com along with your name, location and the time. 
and 
3. Once there you can fill out a profile and track your your GLOBALL as it circles the globe. 

I'm hoping to ask people who they are truly connected to and to redefine terms such as "share", "friend" and "follow". You only get one GLOBALL, who would you give it to?

PLEASE watch my animated video which explains everything. http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/globall If you could please help me to get the word out, we can make the GLOBALL experiment a reality!

Best, 

Oliver
