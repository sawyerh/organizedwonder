Director Godfrey Reggio offers a hypnotic cinematic experience with his latest non-narrative piece, Visitors. The film is comprised of only 74 black-and-white "moving stills" that stare back at you with vivid detail via cutting-edge 4k projection. Sit down with Reggio and co-producer Jon Kane, as they discuss the technology and philosophy behind the making of the film.
