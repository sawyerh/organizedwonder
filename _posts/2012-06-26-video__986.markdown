Bad Racket is a craft recording studio on the west edge of Ohio City. Formed by three passionate music lovers, the studio evolved from raw warehouse into a warm inviting space for musicians to document their creations. In their first year, they've worked with more than thirty-five artists, gained recognition from Cleveland's Press Club, and organized a music festival at the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame.
On the Map is a video series featuring the people and places that make Cleveland a creative, culturally rich, and inspiring place to live and work.
