The world of a type designer is, in reality, not enclosed and solitary anymore, at least it doesn't have to be. Although creating new letterforms is essentially a very personal and subjective matter, it doesn't exclude the potential of a successful collaboration. TypeTogether is proof for that. There is much more to running a type foundry than simply drawing type every day; customer relations, printing piles of test proofs, preparing images for the website, answering questions, traveling to conferences and the list goes on. The video, 'four-hand'typography', lets the audience take a glance into the daily routines of type designers from indispensable customs like espresso drinking to the planning of long-term projects and future outlooks.
