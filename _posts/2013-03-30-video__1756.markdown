Ricky Van Veen ('03) returns to Wake Forest to speak at the second annual TEDxWakeForestU Conference. As a student at Wake Forest in 1999, Van Veen started CollegeHumor in his dorm room.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.
