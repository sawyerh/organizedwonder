"Now you’re seeing these crazy hybrids of music and nobody knows what to call it, which is great. It’s 
like throwing out the blue prints,” says Sepalcure, the project of Travis Stewart, better known by 
his 'Machinedrum' alias, and Praveen Sharma, who produces under 'Brallie' and 'Praveen'. While 
both artists have been on the electronic music scene for over ten years their collaboration is based around 
their shared love for bass and 90's house music that has seen them create some of the most forwardthinking dance music that is equally at home at a late night rave or on headphones. In their debut Australian 
tour together at The Operatives gig, the interview at their SOUNDCHECK offers a playful side of the 
producers, their take on their ever-evolving scene and why it’s more fun on stage with two.
