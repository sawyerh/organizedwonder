A story of guardianship by Kew over one of the world's most economically valuable crops, we reveal the surprisingly fragile foundations that lie beneath the multi-billion pound industry, showing just how important Kew's scientific research is to securing the fate of our cup of coffee.

Commissioned by Kew Gardens for a second year, Lonelyleap were asked to produce two films in continuation of the online content strand, Beyond the Gardens. With a focus on more complex environmental issues, our job was to translate these into concise and digestible films for the public that still retained their scientific accuracy.
