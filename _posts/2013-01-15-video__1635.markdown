We all have an idea we've been meaning to execute on, but how can we really make it happen? In this highly original, all-ages talk, illustrator Rilla Alexander walks us through this classic creative struggle by sharing the story of Sozi - an adorable character who walks us through the arc of an idea. She daydreams, she procrastinates, she sets deadlines, she gets tempted by new ideas, she buckles down and works hard - and finally - she realizes "Her Idea."
