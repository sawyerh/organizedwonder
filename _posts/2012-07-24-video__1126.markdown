Our speaker at the July 2012 Portland/CreativeMornings was William Deresiewicz (billderesiewicz.com). The event was generously hosted by Union / Pine (unionpine.com) and sponsored by 52 Limited (52ltd.com) and Icebreaker (icebreaker.com). Many thanks to Pro Photo Supply (prophotosupply.com) for lending us the gear to capture the talk, and to Paul Searle (maxinedenver.com) for shooting and editing.
