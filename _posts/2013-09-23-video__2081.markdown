“Maybe in the nursing home all the other grandmas will be knitting and I’ll still be making beats,” says Jennifer Lee, better known by her rabbit-themed alias TOKiMONSTA. Since being the first female signed to Brainfeeder, Tokimonsta has established herself as not only a ‘girl DJ’ but also one of the most talented and diverse producers on the scene today. Backstage at SOUNDCHECK before the Melbourne gig of her Australian tour with The Operatives, she gets personal about starting out her career after loosing her day-job, working with Kool Keith and what her mother really thinks about her music, all set to her incredible live performance at the show.
