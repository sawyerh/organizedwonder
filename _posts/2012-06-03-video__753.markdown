Rick Anwyl is a seasoned designer at Son and Sons (sonandsons.com) with over 30 years experience. In this month's session he talks about the beginning of his career, the value of mentors, learning how to say "No," and more great advice for surviving this "crappy" economy.

CreativeMornings is a free, monthly breakfast lecture series for creative types started by Tina Roth Eisenberg (aka @swissmiss). Each event is free of charge, and includes a 20 minute talk, plus free coffee! For more on the bigger picture, check out: creativemornings.com.
