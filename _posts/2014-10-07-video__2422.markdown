Director Matthew Donaldson spent a day with visionary designer Yohji Yamamoto to produce this short film offering a glimpse into his daily life. Yamamoto takes time everyday to drive his ’80s Nissan Cedric along with his dog Rin to Tokyo’s Aoyama Cemetery, whereupon they take a short walk together and enjoy the tranquil atmosphere amongst the vast assortment of tombstones, situated in the middle of the city and not far from his flagship store and studio. Having driven since he was 18 and having owned luxury cars from the likes of Rolls-Royce and Jaguar over the years, Yamamoto now prefers a more subtle vehicle for transport, leading him to buy the Cedric a year ago, around the same time that he also welcomed Rin into his life. Watch the short above for Yamamoto’s meditations on driving and his accomplishments in life.
