"LVRS OF GOD" is an intimate exploration of Theophilus London's chameleonic mind through his inspiration and iconography.

Captured by filmmakers Paul Rojanathara and Davis Johnson (Influencers, Pursuit Of Cool...) during his performances at the Brooklyn Museum and Williamsburg Music Hall in New York,
the short provides a revealing glimpse into early influences that shaped Theophilus London's ascension into a rising icon.
