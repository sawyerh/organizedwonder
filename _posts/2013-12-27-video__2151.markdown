Official Selection of the Raindance Film Festival and the Napa Valley Film Festival.
'TABLE FOR ONE' tells the tale of Philip. His life is in limbo…romantically, professionally…emotionally. 
Today is a bad day. He comes home to find his world turned upside down and is taken on an unexpected journey of self-discovery.
