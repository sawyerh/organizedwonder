BAG MAN is the understated story of a 12 year old African American boy, who takes us on an introspective journey out of the city and into the remote countryside of upstate New York. With a mysterious duffle bag in hand, its contents unknown to us, we journey from the urban hustle of Harlem, into the winter-ravaged woodlands a world away. On the road, we slowly discover his real intentions, and the startling significance of what is hidden inside a young boy’s bag.

Directors JONATHAN & JOSH BAKER thrive on combining hauntingly beautiful imagery with quiet layered emotional experiences. The film juxtaposes high-concept visuals with the most regular of everyday characters and environments, creating an extremely relatable story that engages on multiple levels. Collaboration with the highest quality creative talent is essential with all projects they take on, and BAG MAN is no different – from cinematographer NICOLAS KARAKATSANIS (Academy Award Nominated ‘Bullhead’, ‘The Drop’), to LEGACY EFFECTS (‘Iron Man’, ‘Pacific Rim’, ‘Avatar’), to THE MILL (World-leading, international VFX studio), to colorist TOM POOLE (‘Drive’, ’12 Years A Slave’, ‘Foxcatcher’), to original music by Brooklyn-based threesome BIRD COURAGE.
