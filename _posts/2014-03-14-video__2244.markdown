In the second episode of 'The Finish Line,' an exclusive Grantland series chronicling Steve Nash's season, Nash battles his way back onto the court, celebrates his 40th birthday with a throwback performance against the 76ers, and faces the harsh reality that the Lakers may essentially end his career by exercising the stretch provision.
