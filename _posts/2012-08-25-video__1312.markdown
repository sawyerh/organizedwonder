Tanner Goods is a small leather goods manufacturer located in Portland, Oregon. They work hard to manage multiple storefronts and offer a wide range of hand crafted leather accessories. They thrive on their attention to detail and appreciation for top quality products. In the future they plan to expand their product line to include non-leather goods such as eyewear and time pieces, while maintaining their strong roots in simplicity and utilitarian product design. You can purchase their products online at: tannergoods.com

Or find them in person here:
1308 W. Burnside
Portland, Ore. 97209

This video serves as a documentation of craft that I have long been interested in as a Graphic Designer, and someone who appreciates hand made goods. It is wonderful to see a company that thrives in the "small batch" business model, and I hope they continue to make good things for a long time coming. The process of making something as simple as a belt can remind us of the roots of what this country was founded on: Creativity, Entrepreneurship, and Craftsmanship. Hope you enjoy it!
