During the 70s and 80s performance artist Marina Abramovic engaged in an intense artistic and romantic relationship with fellow performance artist Ulay (Frank Uwe Laysiepen). In 1988 they ended their relationship with a performance art piece in which they met in the middle of the Great Wall of China and said goodbye. They have rarely seen each other since.

In 2010 the MOMA in New York City held a retrospective of the Abramovicâ€™s work. As part of the exhibition, Abramovic sat silently at a table and allowed members of the public to sit across from her. On the opening day of the exhibition, Ulay sat across from Abramovic, resulting in this dramatic and emotional reunion.
