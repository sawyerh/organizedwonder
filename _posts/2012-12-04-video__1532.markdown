Web development never gets boring to Mathias. Not just because nowadays, new “HTML5” technologies are emerging like tubes of spaghetti at a pasta factory — but mostly because there’s always something new to learn. Even the oldest, most reliable features of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, “the basics” that we take for granted every day, are full of hidden gems or restrictions. During this talk, Mathias will take a look at the more obscure parts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and demystify some of them.
