An inside look at the making of critically-acclaimed film, Beasts of the Southern Wild. 

Special Effects Unit Director Ray Tintori talks us through the film's visual effects, and how they had to navigate shots around the tragic Louisiana oil spill. Find out how Zeiltin's blown up truck became a prop, and how "as a community you can challenge some pretty fierce odds" in our behind-the-scenes documentary. 

For the critically acclaimed, breakout feature Beasts of the Southern Wild, Benh Zeitlin and his small film crew, Court 13, set up production in an abandoned convenience store in Montegut, Louisiana to make a film that celebrates a place where people refuse to leave their homesâ€”no matter how dire the situation.
