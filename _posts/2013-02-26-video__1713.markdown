As design director for the Nelson Office, Irving Harper was responsible for some of the most compelling and iconic designs of the twentieth centuryâ€”-from the Marshmallow sofa, to the Ball clock, to the Herman Miller logo itself. While working on the Chrysler Pavilion for the 1964 New York World's Fair, he began making sculptures in his off hours to relieve stress. Some 50 years and roughly 500 pieces later, almost every surface of his Rye, New York home is besieged by evidence of his remarkable skill and creativity.
