Expanding on 21c Museum Hotel's love of all things Derby (including Bourbon!), 21c is collaborating with Brooklyn Derby (http://www.brooklynderby.com/) to "Live Everyday Like the First Saturday in May!"

Having built a popular annual event in New York, the Brooklyn Derby crew takes a trip to Louisville to investigate the special city where Kentucky Derby spirit is alive and well all year long.

This 3-video series covers Louisville (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWDfN...), Bourbon, and Derby Culture.

About Brooklyn Derby
Brooklyn Derby is an annual celebration of the Kentucky Derby that has grown to an attendance of over 600. The goal of the videos is to help viewers better understand Derby traditions and the unique city that spawned this one-of-a-kind tradition.

Stay tuned for final video of the series, and visit http://www.brooklynderby.com/ to learn more about "Living Everyday Like the First Saturday in May!"
