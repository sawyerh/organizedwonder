For Tehran-born and Amsterdam-based designer, Reza Abedini, graphic design is not merely a visual art form but "a value". Combining traditional and contemporary types in his own body of work—logos, posters, corporate identities and three-dimensional designs—for more than 20 years, he is also teaching as professor of graphic design. In our Gestalten.tv feature, he gives insight into the merits of Arabesque 2: Graphic Design from the Arab and Persian World, why there is a "useless distance between the letters" in western printing and how to find one's own visual identity these days.
