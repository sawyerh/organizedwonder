a visual installation by Jeff Desom based on footage from Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window" (1954) 
In the words of the artist:
"I dissected all of Hitchcock's Rear Window and stiched it back together in After Effects. I stabilized all the shots with camera movement in them. Since everything was filmed from pretty much the same angle I was able to match them into a single panoramic view of the entire backyard without any greater distortions. The order of events stays true to the movie's plot."
