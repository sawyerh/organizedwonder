Hundreds of people die every year from being struck by lightning around the world. But nobody tells us the story of the survivors who don't make the headlines.This Mockumentary focuses on one such man, Hoggesh Bedi. Struck by lightning, and abandoned by his friends, family and country. We seek to tell this man's story, because nobody else will bother to do so.
