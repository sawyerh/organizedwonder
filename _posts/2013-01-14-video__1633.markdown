Acclaimed short film. A man recounts his father's life.
“A wonderfully introspective, poignantly sad, short dose of autobiographical cinema, that, at times, reminds one of Chris Marker's most personal works”
(Rex Pickett, Author of 'Sideways')

“An extremely intimate film. It's almost impossible to watch it without thinking hard about the nature of mortality within one's own family.” 
(Simon Ellis, BAFTA nominated Director & Winner of the International Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, 'Soft')
