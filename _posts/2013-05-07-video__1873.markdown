Cirrus is a tune from Bonobo's new album, 'The North Borders'. I've been digging it hard since I heard his interview on All Things Considered. (http://www.npr.org/2013/04/05/176333698/bonobo-challenging-musics-borders-finding-a-new-frontier)

On his website, the video's animator Cyriak says, "It uses clips from a 1962 film about the wonders of consumerism."
