sonder /SAHN-der/
n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own.
From The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows (dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com), a compendium of made-up words written by John Koenig. Each original definition aims to fill a hole in the language, to give a name to an emotion we all feel but donâ€™t have a word for.
