Older demo (2009-2010) of BSContact Geo showcasing a GIS dataset from C3 Technologies (who is now owned by Apple) and the Blue Marble dataset from NASA. The 3D scene is rendered is realtime and streamed depending on the location and angle of view of the user, including multiple level of details.

The city shown here is Marseille (France).
