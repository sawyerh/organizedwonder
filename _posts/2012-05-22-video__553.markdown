Sandra Fisher-Martins runs Português Claro, a training and consultancy firm that introduced plain language in Portugal and has been helping Portuguese companies and government agencies communicate clearly since 2007.
Sandra is particularly interested in the use of plain language and information design in public documents as a way of helping citizens make informed choices about their health, education, welfare, and civil rights.
