@StanleyPiano, the world's first interactive player piano, makes his worldwide debut at Seattle's Capitol Hill Block Party. Stanley is a precocious instrument who takes song requests via Twitter. Stanley can play a lot of songs, but he loves indie music. He even went out of his way to learn a song for each of the bands playing at the Block Party. Stanley bares all as his moving parts (gears, bellows, hammers, valves) visibly work as the keys press themselves.
To make a request or chat with Stanley during the Block Party (July 20-22), simply tweet your song or message to @StanleyPiano. Fans will be notified when their song is up next and view the full list Block Party songs at stanleypiano.com. Stanley is very chatty, so all song requests are welcome. Ask him to play Freebird and see what happens.
Block Party attendees can meet Stanley in person in the parking lot on Pike Street between Poquito's and Havana Social Club.
Can't make it to the Block Party? Enjoy Stanley online, where he's streaming live all three days of the eventâ€”playing tracks for his fans around the world.
