Manuel Gomes Teixeira, photographer and Platinum Palladium printer, usually uses traditional methods, with photographic film in medium and large format cameras.

Invited by the exclusive distributor of Leica cameras in Portugal, he tested the Leica Monochrom. The high quality files, showing a rich tonal range, adapt very well to Platinum printing.
