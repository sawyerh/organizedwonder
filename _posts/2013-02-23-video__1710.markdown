I'm a big fan of Eddie Huang. Guy is a g'.

Vice's latest star Eddie Huang talks about the success of his book and now web series "Fresh Off the Boat." Eddie explains how he found success with his East Village restaurant Baohaus while fighting against the stereotypes he experienced growing up as an Asian American.
