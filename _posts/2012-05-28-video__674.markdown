Concisely recapping 20 years of Erik Brunetti’s involvement with FUCT is difficult; the artist and graffiti writer founded the label in 1990 and has since attracted many people with re-interpreted cultural themes and iconography and above all else a strong opinion. Filmmaker David Gallardo met with Brunetti on several occasions in around the unveiling of his retrospective show at Los Angeles’ Union. In doing so, Brunetti speaks about adhering to the principles that caused him to start the brand, staying relevant, and why is he is not overly eager to please consumers with his designs, but rather aims to educate them. The LA-based label maintains an intelligent and fresh perspective today thanks to Brunetti’s vision.
