Our speaker at the October 2011 Portland/CreativeMornings was the inimitable Kate Bingaman Burt (katebingamanburt.com). The event was generously hosted by Ziba (ziba.com) and sponsored by Scout Books (scoutbooks.com) and Museum of Contemporary Craft (MuseumofContemporaryCraft.org). Many thanks to Paul Searle (psearle.com) for shooting and editing this video.
