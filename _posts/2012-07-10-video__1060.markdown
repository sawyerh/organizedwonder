"The answer will only arrive after we stop looking for it," says bestselling author Jonah Lehrer. Examining recent research into what drives creative insights, Lehrer breaks down how and why we have "aha!" moments, using examples that range from Bob Dylan writing "Like A Rolling Stone" to a Tibetan monk's zen puzzle-solving powers. 

But insight isn't everything. Those who achieve great things in the long-term also have another important quality: Grit, a single-minded persistence that helps them keep their eye on the prize and pushing ever-forward even when the "aha!" moments aren't around.
