Without dispute, Studio on Fire are masters of the design and letterpress world. Their impossibly detailed work, featured in Gestalten's Impressive: Printmaking, Letterpress & Graphic Design, is the product of love, driven by a true passion for paper and print.
Now in their new Minneapolis workshop, SOF principal and design director Ben Levitz gives us insight into the obsessive design process and the beauty of their in-house modern printing capabilities, which include several legendary Heidelberg letterpresses. For Gestalten.tv's new podcast, we're nothing short of deeply impressed.
