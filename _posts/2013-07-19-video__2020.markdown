Alok Shetty designed a full fledged, multi-specialty hospital at the age of 20, and has since then gone onto start a firm that takes simple ideas and combines them with innovative building solutions to bring about radical change in the social infrastructure of a community. Whether its projects like creating rural clinics made of locally available materials, designing aquamarine parks that are a source of fresh water and electricity, or transforming shipping containers into auditoriums, Alok is striving to improve the standard and quality of living in developing countries around the world.
