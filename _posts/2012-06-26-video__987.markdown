2nd Shift is a contemporary product design studio located in Ohio City, Cleveland. It's owned and run by seven partners, a group of creatives with diverse skills and varying backgrounds all working towards a common goal: design and build smart, beautiful, and useful products. Their first year has seen the development of a design studio - workshop, and their first line of products.
On the Map is a video series featuring the people and places that make Cleveland a creative, culturally rich, and inspiring place to live and work
