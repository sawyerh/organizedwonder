Wishing you a Merry Keefmas!

In the spirit of debauched inclusivity, this holiday season The Tremendousness Collective have decided to celebrate something everyone can believe in—something all of us can look at with a wide-eyed sense of wonder and awe—Keith Richards’ 70th birthday, which happens to be today, December 18, 2013!
