The Cleveland Cinematheque seeks out independent films that otherwise would not be shown in the city, and throughout the years has garnered much recognition. Director John Ewing was named a Chevalier in the order of Arts and Letters by the French Government, and the New York Times touts the cinematheque as one of the country's best repertory movie theatres.
On the Map is a video series featuring the people and places that make Cleveland a creative, culturally rich, and inspiring place to live and work.
