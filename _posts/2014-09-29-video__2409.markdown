Credited by many as the leading figure in 'doodle' art culture, Jon Burgerman is a British artist currently residing in Williamsburg, New York. Often using art as a positive cause to reflect and change our perception of the world, Jon's passion and enthusiasm for creating has led to a whole host of collaborations, exhibitions and publications, as well as various animations and even a pop-art band. Desillusion Magazine spent an afternoon in Brooklyn with one of the most unique and exciting artists working today.

This short film is based on the article “Teletubbies on Acid” published in Desillusion Magazine 46 , Tome 2 available on http://tinyurl.com/ncm2gy6
