This was one of my highlights from the 2012 WMC Fest. Johnny went hours beyond the allotted time, but all of the business tips and knowledge he throws out is well worth the watch. Unfortunately I couldn't find the slides, which add a lot to what he talks about. If they're released, they should show up here: https://speakerdeck.com/u/wmcfest
