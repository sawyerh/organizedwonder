"Cancer is not a demographic."

Woody Roseland lives to laugh, to dream, and to be HERE. From his story, it wouldn't seem like he has anything to laugh about. As a sophomore in high school, he experienced a pain in his leg that wasn't just a bruise, it was cancer. Since, he has overcome cancer five times, and through it all has discovered the most important aspects of life. In this engaging and moving talk, Woody tells his serious story with humor, and asks us to participate in loving life and understand the weight of 'You Are Here'.
