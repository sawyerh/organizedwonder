Dream is a commercial for Louis Vuitton’s Muhammad Ali campaign. Directed by Stuart McIntyre, the ad stars hip hop superstar Mos Def (now performing as Yasiin Bey) and calligraffiti artist Niels Shoe Meulman and features Muhammad Ali’s epic Rumble in the Jungle poem/master class in trashing talk (original words below).

Last night I had a dream, When I got to Africa,
I had one hell of a rumble.
I had to beat Tarzan’s behind first,
For claiming to be King of the Jungle.
For this fight, I’ve wrestled with alligators,
I’ve tussled with a whale.
I done handcuffed lightning
And throw thunder in jail.
You know I’m bad.
just last week, I murdered a rock,
Injured a stone, Hospitalized a brick.
I’m so mean, I make medicine sick.
I’m so fast, man,
I can run through a hurricane and don’t get wet.
When George Foreman meets me,
He’ll pay his debt.
I can drown the drink of water, and kill a dead tree.
Wait till you see Muhammad Ali.
