Shwood founder Eric Singer teams up with friends to create a unique wooden surfboard. Watch how Singer and company process and shape this functional one-of-a-kind board using reclaimed wood found on the Oregon coast.
The construction process was guided by the expertise of Joe Blecha, a bona fide virtuoso of custom surf and snowboard construction. blechaboardshop.com
Kahana Kalama, professional surfer turned shop-owner (alohasunday.com), was there to test the limits of the handmade board upon its completion.
Based in Portland, Oregon, Shwood creates handcrafted wooden eyewear using fine exotic hardwoods. Shwood’s in-house manufacturing process merges precision technology with classic skilled craftsmanship to create a timeless art form. Every step from veneering and precision lens cutting, to shaping and finishing is conducted in our own Portland-based workshop to promise an entirely handcrafted eyewear piece.
