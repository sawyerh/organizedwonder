Sadhguru speaks of the creator and creation and how people tend to divide between the two by thinking that the creator is great, but the creation is filthy.

Sadhguru explains that whatever idea you have about God is only a definition according to what we see around us, as most people see God as an exaggerated version of themselves. Whatever is the source of creation can only be experienced and not understood.

Yogi, mystic and visionary, Sadhguru is a spiritual master with a difference. An arresting blend of profundity and pragmatism, his life serves as a reminder that yoga is a contemporary science, vitally relevant to our times.
